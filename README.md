## UPDATES
2020-09-16: V1.0.0.0 Release

## REQUIREMENTS
BepinEx
ModLoader

## OPTIONAL
AutoConverter

## INSTALL
###### Plugin
  Place COM3D2.SplitHairSliders.dll in your BepinEx plugins folder

###### Base Package
  Place the [SplitHairSliders] folder directly in your Mod folder (eg C:\KISS\COM3D2\Mod\[SplitHairSliders]) do not place it anywhere else

## USE
If you used the base package of menus you should simply see the new hair options

If you wish to export any additional hair .menu files with the additional sliders
  1) Go into Edit mode
  2) Open Gear Menu
  3) Press the SplitHairSliders button (Scissors and Comb)
  4) Set your preferred options and then press Export
  5) Leave and return to Edit Mode to see the new .menu files take effect

## KNOWN ISSUES
There is a small issue with your Maid's hair color being gray after performing an export, just re-click the hair's button to refresh the color properly,
I probably won't bother fixing this minor issue.

## LEGAL
I do not own any of the created .menu files, they were created by KISS and modified by me.
See their standard rules on mod distribution on their website.
By using this plugin you agree that I and/or KISS am not responsible/liable for anything that happens to your PC, use at your own risk.
